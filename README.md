Installation:

-Input your even and odd schedule in background.py
  -If you have a free period, write anything. Do not leave it blank
  -This is done right after all modules are imported. 


-In startup.bat, replace the file path on line 1 with the path to the program. 
-If you want the program to run on startup, move startup.bat into the windows startup folder.

Note: 
-This program is designed to run on a SteelSeries Apex 7. It should techincally work on any screen with some modifications though.
